GenAI Web Development Performance Testing
Overview
This project aims to explore and evaluate the performance of new Generative AI (GenAI) models in the context of web development. The focus is on assessing the ability of these AI models to generate, optimize, and automate web development tasks such as coding, design, and debugging.

Features
Performance Benchmarking: Measure the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of various GenAI models when generating web code.
Automation: Evaluate how well AI models can automate common web development tasks (e.g., HTML/CSS generation, responsive design, JavaScript implementation).
Real-World Use Cases: Test the AI's performance on real-world web development scenarios, including interactive UIs, form handling, and API integration.
Code Quality Assessment: Analyze the generated code for best practices, including readability, maintainability, and scalability.
AI-Assisted Debugging: Evaluate how effectively the models can assist in identifying and fixing bugs in existing code.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
GenAI Models: [Include details about specific GenAI models tested, e.g., GPT-4, Codex, etc.]
Libraries & Frameworks: Flask, React, TailwindCSS, etc.
Tools for Benchmarking: Pytest, Lighthouse, GTmetrix, etc.
